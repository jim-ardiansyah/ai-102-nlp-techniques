It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language, opening up a world of possibilities for applications ranging from chatbots and translation services to sentiment analysis and beyond. The evolution of NLP has been driven by significant advances in machine learning and deep learning, which have enabled more sophisticated and accurate models for language understanding.
